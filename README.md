# Passenger Flights Planning Model Based on Airlines On-Time Performance Data
A model using Decision Trees and Random Forests to help passengers plan their trips by predicting the delay of a desired flight. The most important part is selecting the best fitting variables out of so many in the raw dataset. Those are the variables a passenger should provide to get a predicted delay.
